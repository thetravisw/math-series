# math-series

**Author**: Travis Williams
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
A simple program that calculates the Nth number of the fibbonaci series, the Nth number of the Lucas series, or the Nth number of any given series folling the same pattern.

Written more for the practice with pytest than for any actual practical application

## Getting Started
Just install it and go.  (Note, as of yet, it doesn't 
actually call any of the functions, nor query user for
parameters).  Might wanna change that if you actually intend to use.

## Architecture
python 3.8.0, testing by pytest.
